# DelugeRPG Cheats

DelugeRPG is a 2D Pokémon-based fan-made browser game that consists on walking around maps, battling and capturing Pokémons.

The cheats are userscripts (JavaScript programs that modify web pages) and can be used through userscript managers, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

## Tampermonkey

Userscript manager available as a browser extension.

To get it running, it's first necessary to go through a few steps:

1. Install Tampermonkey in your browser
2. Open the extension panel
3. Access *Dashboard*
4. Select the tab *[+]* to the left of *Installed Userscripts*
5. Paste the code of chosen userscript
6. Press `Ctrl+S` to save it or click on *File* and then *Save*
7. You're done!

Toggle the userscripts on or off as needed.

## Cheats

### Auto Catcher

Controls the player to walk back and forth looking for legendary or retro (rarest type) pokémons.

Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` to access the browser console and track the pokémons that appear.

When found, it uses Ultra Balls for retros and Master Balls for legendaries. Make sure to buy a few of each in the market.

After the catch, it returns to the map automatically and starts the search again.

Make sure to keep *Enable Keyboard Navigation?* option enabled!

### Auto Trainer

Keeps leveling the first pokémon of your team based on the training accounts by [Sugus2](https://www.delugerpg.net/viewtopic.php?t=6).

Set the desired type in the userscript and battle.

Take into account the type of the first attack of the trained pokémon.
