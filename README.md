# DelugeRPG Cheats

DelugeRPG is a 2D Pokémon-based fan-made browser game that consists on walking around maps, battling and capturing Pokémons.

The cheats are userscripts (JavaScript programs used to modify web pages) and can be used through userscript managers, such as Tampermonkey.

## Tampermonkey

[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is a userscript manager that is available as a browser extension.

## Cheats

### Auto Catcher

Controls the player to walk back and forth looking for legendary or retro (rarest type) pokémons.

Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` to access the browser console and track the pokémons that appear.

When found, it uses Ultra Balls for retros and Master Balls for legendaries. Make sure to buy a few of each in the market.

It returns to the map automatically and starts the search again.

### Auto Trainer

Keeps training the first pokémon of your team.

Its based on the training accounts by [Sugus2](https://www.delugerpg.net/viewtopic.php?t=6).

Set the desired type in the userscript and battle.

Take into account the type of the first attack of the trained pokémon.
